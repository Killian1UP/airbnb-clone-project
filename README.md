- check_out: End date of the booking.

Relationships:
- A booking belongs to one user and one property.
- A booking can be associated with one payment.

4. Reviews: Represents feedback and ratings left by users for properties.

Key Fields:
- id: Unique identifier for the review.
- user_id: References the reviewer.
- property_id: References the property being reviewed.
- rating: Numerical rating (e.g., 1 to 5).
- comment: Written feedback.

Relationships:
- A review belongs to one user and one property.
- A property can have many reviews.

5. Payments: Represents transactions made for bookings.

Key Fields:
- id: Unique identifier for the payment.
- booking_id: References the associated booking.
- amount: Total amount paid.
- payment_method: Type of payment used (e.g., credit card, PayPal).
- status: Status of the payment (e.g., successful, pending, failed).

Relationships:
- A payment is linked to one booking.
- A booking has one associated payment.

Entity Relationship Summary:
- A User can own many Properties.
- A User can make many Bookings.
- A User can write many Reviews.
- A Property can have many Bookings and Reviews.
- A Booking is linked to one User, one Property, and one Payment.
- A Review is linked to one User and one Property.
- A Payment is linked to one Booking.

Feature Breakdown:
1. User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management. It will enable users to register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.
2. Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
3. Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details. Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.
4. Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details. It will enable the app to handle payment transactions related to bookings.
5. Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
6. Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations. By the use of indexing and caching.

API Security:
Ensuring the security of the API is critical to protect user data, enable safe transactions, and maintain trust in the Airbnb Clone platform. The following security measures will be implemented to safeguard various components of the system:

1. Authentication
Implementation: We will implement token-based authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) through Django REST Framework's djangorestframework-simplejwt package. This ensures that only authenticated users can access protected endpoints such as booking properties, managing listings, or making payments.

2. Authorization:
Implementation: Role-based access control (RBAC) will be applied to distinguish between different types of users (e.g., hosts and guests). Django REST Framework’s permission classes will be customized to enforce access control on sensitive operations (e.g., only property owners can edit or delete their listings). It ensures users can only access or modify resources they own or have permission to use. This prevents misuse or unauthorized access to data.

3. Rate Limiting:
Implementation: Rate limiting will be implemented using tools like Django Ratelimit or integrated through API gateways (e.g., NGINX or third-party services like Cloudflare) to prevent abuse. Rate limiting protects the API from brute-force attacks, DoS (Denial-of-Service) attacks, and ensures fair use of resources by all users.

4. Data Encryption:
Implementation: All data in transit will be encrypted using HTTPS (SSL/TLS). Sensitive data such as passwords will be hashed using secure algorithms like PBKDF2 (provided by Django by default). Encryption protects user credentials, personal data, and payment information from being intercepted by attackers during transmission.

5. Secure Payment Processing:
Implementation: Payments will be handled via integration with trusted third-party payment gateways (e.g., Stripe or PayPal), ensuring PCI compliance. Sensitive payment information will never be stored on our servers. Handling payments securely is essential to prevent fraud, data breaches, and to ensure user trust in the booking process.

6. Input Validation & Sanitization:
Implementation: All user input will be validated and sanitized on both frontend and backend. Django’s built-in protections against SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) will be utilized. Improper input handling can lead to vulnerabilities such as XSS or SQL injection, potentially compromising the system or user data.

7. Logging and Monitoring:
Implementation: Security-related events (e.g., failed login attempts, unauthorized access) will be logged and monitored for early detection of suspicious activity. Alerts and audits will be set up where necessary. aProactive monitoring helps identify and mitigate threats early, reducing the risk of data breaches or service disruptions.

CI/CD Pipeline:
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery. It is a set of automated practices used to streamline the development, testing, and deployment of software.
- Continuous Integration (CI): Automatically tests and integrates code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository, ensuring the application remains stable and error-free.
- Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD): Automatically deploys code to production or staging environments after passing tests, reducing manual steps and the risk of human error.

Importance for This Project
Implementing a CI/CD pipeline ensures that:
- Code changes are automatically tested, reducing bugs and ensuring code quality.
- Developers receive immediate feedback on integration issues.
- New features and fixes are deployed quickly and reliably.
- The project remains scalable and maintainable as it grows.

Tools That Could Be Used
- GitHub Actions: Automates testing, linting, and deployment workflows directly from the GitHub repository.
- Docker: Ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production by containerizing the application.
- Docker Compose: Manages multi-container applications for local development and testing.
- Heroku / Render / AWS / Azure (optional): Can be used as hosting platforms for deploying the backend API.
- PostgreSQL & Redis Containers: Used in the pipeline for testing interactions with actual services.
