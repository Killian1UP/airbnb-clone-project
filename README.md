Overview of the project

Objective:
The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

Project Goals:
1. User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
2. Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
3. Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
4. Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
5. Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
6. Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

Technology Stack:
- Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
- GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- Redis: Used for caching and session management.
- Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

Team Roles:
- Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
- Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
- DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
- QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

Database Design:
- Users: Users of the app can have multiple properties to book and view, make reviews of them and make payments for the desired booking.
- Properties: The properties on the app will enable users to make bookings or advertise to potential clients, have reviews on the quality of the properties and have payment methods.
- Bookings: Users will be able to view their bookings and the properties attached to them plus the reviews of the properties.
- Reviews: Each property will have reviews attached to it to enable users to see the quality of the property and to review for themselves. 
- Payments: For each booking, users will be able to make payments regarding the different packages offered depending on the stay.

Feature Breakdown:
1. User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management. It will enable users to register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.
2. Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
3. Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details. Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.
4. Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details. It will enable the app to handle payment transactions related to bookings.
5. Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
6. Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations. By the use of indexing and caching.

API Security:
Ensuring the security of the API is critical to protect user data, enable safe transactions, and maintain trust in the Airbnb Clone platform. The following security measures will be implemented to safeguard various components of the system:

1. Authentication
Implementation: We will implement token-based authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) through Django REST Framework's djangorestframework-simplejwt package. This ensures that only authenticated users can access protected endpoints such as booking properties, managing listings, or making payments.

2. Authorization:
Implementation: Role-based access control (RBAC) will be applied to distinguish between different types of users (e.g., hosts and guests). Django REST Framework’s permission classes will be customized to enforce access control on sensitive operations (e.g., only property owners can edit or delete their listings). It ensures users can only access or modify resources they own or have permission to use. This prevents misuse or unauthorized access to data.

3. Rate Limiting:
Implementation: Rate limiting will be implemented using tools like Django Ratelimit or integrated through API gateways (e.g., NGINX or third-party services like Cloudflare) to prevent abuse. Rate limiting protects the API from brute-force attacks, DoS (Denial-of-Service) attacks, and ensures fair use of resources by all users.

4. Data Encryption:
Implementation: All data in transit will be encrypted using HTTPS (SSL/TLS). Sensitive data such as passwords will be hashed using secure algorithms like PBKDF2 (provided by Django by default). Encryption protects user credentials, personal data, and payment information from being intercepted by attackers during transmission.

5. Secure Payment Processing:
Implementation: Payments will be handled via integration with trusted third-party payment gateways (e.g., Stripe or PayPal), ensuring PCI compliance. Sensitive payment information will never be stored on our servers. Handling payments securely is essential to prevent fraud, data breaches, and to ensure user trust in the booking process.

6. Input Validation & Sanitization:
Implementation: All user input will be validated and sanitized on both frontend and backend. Django’s built-in protections against SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) will be utilized. Improper input handling can lead to vulnerabilities such as XSS or SQL injection, potentially compromising the system or user data.

7. Logging and Monitoring:
Implementation: Security-related events (e.g., failed login attempts, unauthorized access) will be logged and monitored for early detection of suspicious activity. Alerts and audits will be set up where necessary. aProactive monitoring helps identify and mitigate threats early, reducing the risk of data breaches or service disruptions.
